# Raspberry-Pi-Controls-Robot
Demonstrates a Raspberry Pi can be used to control a robot with wheels using a web camara. 
The OpenCV demo found here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d7f/samples_2cpp_2camshiftdemo_8cpp-example.html was modfied to send a "Turn Left" or "Turn Right" signal to 
a robot with wheels. For more details, please view the PDF file found here: https://github.com/mathurpratik/Raspberry-Pi-Controls-Robot/blob/main/ENEE699-Section-0301-Mathur-Pratik.pdf

#Arduino Mega
Under the raspi_arduino directory you will find a file written using the Arduino language that recevies "Turn Left" or "Turn Right" signals from the Raspberry Pi
