# Raspberry-Pi-Controls-Robot
This project demonstrates that a Raspberry Pi can be used to control a robot with wheels using a web camara. 
The OpenCV object-tracking demo found here: https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d7f/samples_2cpp_2camshiftdemo_8cpp-example.html was modfied to send a "Turn Left" or "Turn Right" signals to a robot. 

# Arduino Mega
Under the raspi_arduino directory you will find a file raspi_arduino.ino written using the Arduino language that recevies "Turn Left" or "Turn Right" signals from the Raspberry Pi.
